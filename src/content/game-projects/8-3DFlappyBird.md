This game is built to teach the basics of 3D game development in Dian Nuswantoro Computer Club (DNCC). To keep it simple, I used finish line as the goal instead of infinite pipes using object pooling. I used Unity Asset Store to get the 3D assets and the background music. I also used Unity's built-in physics engine to make the bird fly and fall. I also created full tutorial on how to make this game on my Youtube channel. You can watch it [here](https://youtu.be/C1x61kK0vEM?si=QEHwmw7yrj-skrmO).
