This game is a collaborative project with Excatz Studio, created for participation in Game Seed 2024, the largest game competition in Indonesia. I served as the lead programmer on this project, developing several core features, including enemy pathfinding, enemy wave systems, player movement, camera control, seed-growing mechanics, shooting mechanics, enemy attacks, and more. This game is on itch.io, and you can play it [here](https://ulungsubekti.itch.io/verdant-siege).
